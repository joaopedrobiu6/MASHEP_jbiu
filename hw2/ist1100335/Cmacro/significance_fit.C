// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// In this exercise, you are given a file containing an analysis TTree with selected event data from the search
// for a Higgs boson decaying to WW pairs, where both W bosons decay leptonically.

// The TTree contains several observables, such as:

//  mLL: invariant mass of the dilepton pair
//  ptLL: transverse momentum of the dilepton pair
//  dPhi_LL: angular separation in azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons of the event
//  dPhiLLmet: angular separation in azimuthal angle between missing transverse energy and the dilepton pair
//  MET: missing transverse energy
//  mT: transverse mass (i.e. invariant mass calculated with the transverse components of missing ET and 
//  the two leptons)
//  goodjet_n: number of jets in the event (after quality criteria)
//  goodbjet_n: number of b jets in the event (after quality criteria)
//  For each of the leptons: transverse momentum pT, eta (pseudorapidity), energy E, azimuthal angle phi and charge
//  process: label indicating the kind of background taken into account
//  label: 0 for background, 1 for signal (valid only in MC simulation, for real data is -1)
//  weight: correction factors to take into account differences in reconstruction between data and MC simulation 
//  scale_weight: total event weight (including the MC correction weight above) used to normalise each event to 
//  its physical expectation, such that the sum of scale_weight yields the total number of expected events for the process


// The goals of this exercise are:

// 1) Make histograms of a few variables for the signal and background in the same plot (pTLL, dPhiLLmet, dPhi_LL, MET, mT). 
//     (Tip: you may first explore the TTree using the TBrowser to check the limits of the distributions)
// 2) Choose two variables for the signal selection optimisation. Justify your choice. 
// 3) Optimize the signal selection criteria using these two variables.
// 4) Draw the mT (transverse invariant mass of the WW pair) distribution after applying your selection conditions for the signal and the backgrounds with data and MC.
// 5) Build a test-statistics for signal discovery and use the data to perform a maximum-likelihood fit 
// to compute the observed and signal strength in the data sample, using mT as observable. 
// Based on the results of the test statistics, which one of the two hypotheses is more likely (background only or signal+background)? 
// Explain the reasoning behind your answer.
